# Path Planning

This repository contains the code for the path planning project.

The code is in `src/main.cpp` and it makes use of [`spline.h`](http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/) library. In the following sections, the code is described with reference to `main.cpp` lines.

#### Driving around the track

The car uses Frenet coordinates to drive along the track within a given lane. The lane is initially set to `1` as the car initial position is in the middle lane (line 19). The car moves along the track by following a trajectory computed at each time step. The trajectory is calculated by `generateNewTrajectory()` function (defined at line 172), where three points are interpolated by means of splines. This approach has been taken from the walkthrough video; the resulting trajectory is smooth as this is calculated using two points from the previous trajectory. The computed trajectory seems to minimize the jerk as well: this is thanks to the smoothness of interpolating splines. If a lane different from the current one is passed to the function, a new lane-shifting smooth trajectory is generated.

#### Adapting speed

The car speed is controlled by the variable `target_speed`, which is initially set to zero (line 24). If the road in front of the car is free, the speed is slowly increased to 49.5mph (line 516; this ensures that we do not exceed the 50mph limit).

The function `lookAhead()` makes use of the `sensor_fusion` data to identify cars in front of us (line 279). The function loops all the sensor fusion data until it finds a car in the same lane of us (line 288). If the found car is closer than a threshold depending on our speed (line 303), the `target_speed` is decreased with a parabolic law. This ensures a smooth deceleration when the other car is far, but allows an emergency brake when a car suddenly moves in front of us. Whenever a slow car is found, the `too_close` flag is set to `true` to trigger the lane shift operation.

#### Passing cars

The passing behavior is defined in `checkLanes()` function (line 366). Here, depending on the current lane, the adjacent lanes are checked for other cars. The single lane check is done by `checkLane()` function (line 323). In the candidate lane we check for cars closer than 30m in front of us or 10m behind us, as in these cases it is too dangerous to make the lane shift. If the candidate lane is safe, the `lane` variable is changed accordingly. As a common sense rule, the lane shift towards the left- is preferred to the one towards the right-lane.

Below there are two examples of the car driving autonomously around the track. In the first case, the car changes lane to pass the center lane slower car, then it slows down as all the three lanes are occupied.

In the second case, the car finds space to make the lane shift and accelerates to 50mph.

The car was able to travel around the entire track without collisions or warnings of any kind (see figure below).

#### Limitations

The car drives using a fairly simple finite state machine and makes no use of path search algorithms. An improvement on the actual implementation would consist in using sensor data from all the lanes, build a maze-like environment, and run the A* algorithm to find the best (i.e. speed optimized) path.

## Installation instructions

### Simulator.
You can download the Term3 Simulator which contains the Path Planning Project from the [releases tab (https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).

### Goals
In this project your goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. You will be provided the car's localization and sensor fusion data, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 50 m/s^3.

#### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time.

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates.

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.

## Tips

A really helpful resource for doing this project and creating smooth trajectories was using http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/, the spline function is in a single hearder file is really easy to use.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!


## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
